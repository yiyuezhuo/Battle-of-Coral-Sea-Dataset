# Julia package `BattleOfCoralSeaUtils`

A tiny Julia package, you can `dev` or `add` it from local as "usual" (Ok, in fact you can't `add` or `dev` it from as true usual way, say a git or GitHub url.). Or you can just `include` the path of `BattleOfCoralSeaUtils.jl` to use the module.

The package is made like this since I don't think a utils collection is suitable to become a package, but Julia's current structure make you to push all of things into a package.
